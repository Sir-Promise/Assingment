(What’s wrong with this code?)

rating = int(input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10'))

#The wrongs with this code is that it doesn't check if the input is between 1 and 10 as prompted. it will accept and print whatever number that is entered and in the same line without any form of demacations or use of colon nor space to seperate it. 
#Secondly,If the string passed to int cannot be converted to an integer, a ValueError occurs.
